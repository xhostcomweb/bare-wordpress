# Bare Wordpress

Starter theme for Wordpress (no framework.)

## Quick Start

Put in scripts/css framework/whatever and add to functions.php or in the case of css use @import call in style.css (remove the default file in styles folder..) So use anything at all. Maybe use Navwalker php import depending on style.

Useful quick start parent theme project.
